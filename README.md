# Light Indexed Deferred Rendering

*Note: Research project from 2007*

Current rasterization based renderers utilize one of two main techniques for lighting, forward rendering and deferred rendering. However, both of these techniques have disadvantages. 
Forward rendering does not scale well with complex lighting scenes and standard deferred rendering has high memory usage and trouble with transparency and MSAA.

This research project aims to explore a middle ground between these two lighting techniques with the aim of keeping the key advantages of both.

This research was featured in the book 
ShaderX7 Advanced Rendering Techniques 
Chapter 2.9 Light Indexed Deferred Rendering
